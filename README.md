### Objective

Deliver software and infrastructure solutions to real-world problems, preferably by developing and using free and open-source software (F/OSS).

### About me

**I am originally a self-taught developer.** In 2007 I taught myself enough Ruby to automate parts of the job I had then.
**I prefer being a part of a small team.** I work best on a team with 2-8 people, with a dedicated project manager.
**I prefer face-to-face communication.** I communicate my ideas best via high-bandwidth, face-to-face contact rather than over tools like Slack or e-mail.
**I am a visual thinker.** I visualize problems and solutions to them and tend to draw my notes more frequently than I write them.
**I learn by doing.** I wasn't able to get into software development until I had a problem to solve. The knowledge I have today is mostly that which I've gained practicing software development rather than reading or studying about it.
**I like pair-programming.** I tend not to want to pair-program 100% of the time, but I am happy to pair-program to get past a tricky issue or ramp up a new engineer.

### My motto

> There's always a better way.

There's almost always a better way of doing something. There's also a point of diminishing returns. I aim to find the balance. I used this motto to drive my decision to teach myself software development, and I use it on an ongoing basis to drive the decisions that I make day-to-day writing software.
