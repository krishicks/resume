### Objective

Deliver software and infrastructure solutions to real-world problems, preferably by developing and using free and open-source software (F/OSS).

### About me

I am a highly productive software and infrastructure/DevOps engineer. I bring to the table a decade of experience building and shipping production software. In that time, I have developed a wide range of experience, including being an individual contributor as well as managing multiple open- and closed-source software and infrastructure projects. I care about developer productivity and autonomy, reducing toil, and delivering software and infrastructure solutions with a pragmatic approach. I am familiar with multiple cloud infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, as well as multiple container schedulers, including Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, both as an engineer and as an operator/admin. I am well-versed in test-driven development and agile development practices, prefer tests over comments, and automation over documentation wherever possible. I love Linux, Vim, Git, and Go.

### My motto

> There's always a better way.

There's almost always a better way of doing something. There's also a point of diminishing returns. I aim to find a balance. I used this motto to drive my decision to teach myself software development, and I use it on an ongoing basis to drive the decisions that I make day-to-day writing software.
